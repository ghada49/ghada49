## 🚀 Projects  

### 💡Flagship Systems & Platforms

#### ⚡ EDL SmartGrid — FastAPI, React, Docker, Redis, ML (OCSVM, PCA, AE, IF, LOF)
• Engineered a production-grade AI platform that detects anomalous electricity consumption patterns across Lebanon’s buildings.

• Designed a complete pipeline linking data ingestion → ML-driven anomaly detection → automated case creation → inspections → final managerial decisions.

• Built an ensemble-based anomaly engine with rank fusion, drift monitoring, and a model registry powered by asynchronous Redis workers for scalable training and activation.

• Developed role-specific dashboards for citizens, inspectors, managers, and admins, featuring geo-aware routing, PDF inspection uploads, and dataset-triggered model deployment.

#### 🔐 PolyLab — GF(2ᵐ) Cryptography Platform (React, FastAPI, Argon2id, MFA, RBAC)

• Built a full-stack educational platform combining secure authentication (Argon2id, MFA, email verification) with a GF(2ᵐ) polynomial arithmetic engine.

• Implemented a mathematically verified calculator supporting addition, multiplication, inversion, exponentiation, and AES-based irreducible polynomials with 100% correctness (exhaustive V&V tests).

• Developed role-based system (student/instructor/admin) with instructor requests, classroom management, assignments, uploads, and submissions.

• Designed React/Vite frontend: calculator UI, student dashboard, instructor tools, and admin console.

• Built FastAPI backend with session cookies, CSRF protection, rate limiting, secure upload handling, and modular routers.

### 🤖 Generative AI & LLM Projects

#### 🧩 Self-Healing Data Parser — Python, LLM Agents, Sandbox Execution  
• Built an agentic LLM system that converts messy, unstructured text into clean JSON by generating custom Python parsers.  

• Implemented a self-healing loop where the agent writes code, executes it in a restricted sandbox, inspects failures, and automatically repairs the parser.

• Designed a secure execution environment with AST checks, blocked imports, timeouts, and forbidden operations to safely run model-generated code.  

• Delivered a Gradio UI that returns both the extracted JSON and the final working parser code.

#### 📄 AI-Powered Company Brochure Generator — Python, OpenAI API, Streamlit
• Built an LLM-driven system that analyzes company websites, selects brochure-relevant pages, and generates factual Markdown brochures.

• Implemented intelligent link selection using structured JSON outputs to avoid irrelevant or unsafe pages.

• Designed the system to generate content **only from scraped sources**, appending a Sources section to reduce hallucinations.

• Delivered both CLI and Streamlit UI for non-technical users.
